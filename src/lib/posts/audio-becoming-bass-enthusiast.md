excerpt: My personal journey from doubting deep bass to embracing rich, detailed low-end frequencies.
---

For the longest time, I never considered myself a fan of bass-heavy music. My preferences leaned distinctly toward detailed mids, crystal-clear highs, and just enough bass to round out the soundstage. However, my perspective recently underwent a fascinating shift—I’ve discovered an unexpected passion for the deeper end of the audio spectrum.

Here's the story of how my scepticism transformed into enthusiasm.

## The turning point

My first real encounter with high-quality bass came when I tried headphones renowned for their exceptional bass performance—namely, Audeze's planar magnetic headphones and Apple's AirPods Max. What I previously dismissed as excessive or muddy bass suddenly revealed itself as a nuanced, textured, and thoroughly immersive listening experience.

This revelation completely redefined my perception of what bass could be.

## What makes quality bass?

Good bass is about much more than sheer volume or impact; it's about:

- **Control:** No bloated resonances or muddiness; just precise, tight sound.
- **Depth:** Effortlessly reaching deep into sub-bass frequencies without distortion.
- **Texture:** Rich, detailed low-end nuances, clearly defined and distinguishable.

Planar magnetic headphones exemplify these qualities superbly. Unlike conventional dynamic drivers, planar headphones feature large, ultra-thin diaphragms driven evenly by magnets. This technology delivers incredible precision, clarity, and a beautifully balanced frequency response.

A prime example is the **Audeze MM-100**: it sports a substantial 90 mm planar membrane, considerably larger than typical dynamic drivers, offering tighter control and richer textures across the entire audio spectrum.

## Re-evaluating my audio preferences

For most of my life, I identified as a bass sceptic, prioritizing clarity and dynamics over what I perceived as overwhelming bass. However, I realized that my issue wasn't with bass itself but with its typical representation—often loose, muddy, and poorly controlled.

This realization crystallized after acquiring the **Ultimate Ears Reference Remastered (UERR)** custom in-ear monitors (IEMs) and the aforementioned Audeze MM-100 headphones. Both models offer an exceptional combination of precise bass control and expansive soundstage, delivering clear, articulate bass without compromising overall transparency.

## Embracing the bass experience
Since discovering the charm of high-quality bass, I've transitioned from being a bass sceptic to an enthusiast. I wouldn't describe myself as a "basshead," yet I undeniably appreciate and seek out the richness and dynamism that quality bass offers.

If you find yourself sceptical of bass-heavy music, I encourage you to give it another chance. Consider investing in headphones or earphones known for their controlled and detailed bass performance. Specifically, I recommend:

Planar magnetic headphones, such as:

* Audeze MM-100
* Audeze LCD-2C

These headphones excel in providing precise control, deep extension, and clear textural details across the entire frequency range.

Alternatively, for in-ear monitors (IEMs), highly regarded options with dynamic and articulate bass include:

* Kiwi Ears Quintet
* Moondrop Blessing 3

## Conclusion
Although I remain discerning about bass reproduction, my journey has transformed me into an enthusiastic advocate of high-quality, well-represented bass. I hope my experience inspires you to explore and enjoy the profound depths and dynamics that exceptional bass performance has to offer.
