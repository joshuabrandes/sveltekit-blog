excerpt: A journey from doubting deep bass to embracing rich low-end frequencies.
---

For the longest time, I never considered myself someone who particularly enjoyed bass-heavy music. My preferences were clear: detailed mids, crystal-clear highs, and just enough bass to round out the soundstage. But lately, something changed—and I found myself becoming increasingly captivated by the deeper end of the audio spectrum.

Here's how my perspective shifted from scepticism to enthusiasm:

### The turning point

My first major step towards appreciating bass was listening through headphones known for their excellent bass quality—specifically, Audeze headphones and Apple’s AirPods Max. Suddenly, what had always seemed excessive or muddy became a textured, controlled, and immersive experience.

### Understanding quality bass

Good bass is about more than volume; it’s about:

- **Control:** No unwanted resonances or bloating.
- **Depth:** Ability to reach lower frequencies effortlessly.
- **Texture:** Rich details within the low-end notes.

Planar headphones are a great example of this. They enable a wide frequency range, but offer outstanding dynamics and texture. This is made possible by the driver designs with a relatively big membranes, enabling tight control over the sound.
A great example are the Audeze MM-100, they have a 90 mm membrane, wich is relarively big, compared to widespread dynamic drivers.
This enables a wide frequency range, with preciset control across the whole frequency spectrum.

Honestly, I have been a bass sceptic for the first part of my life, favoring clarity and dynamics over overwhelming bass.
As I learned this wasn't because I do not appreciate bass, but because I favor tight, clear and controlled bass ofer a more loose abss representation.
That became clear when I got a pair ofd Ultimate Ears Reference Remastered (UERR) custim IEMs and Audesze MM-100 headphones.
These offer a great combination of quality bass and a great soundstage; delvering great clear bass representation while havering a transparent overall soundstage.

### The next step

Honestly since I experienced this more sophisticated bass represenatioj i turned from a bass-sceptic to a bass-enthusiast.
I wouldn't  all myself a basshead, but I am now definitely a bass-enthusiast. I enjoy the richness of bass and the dynmaics offered by a good bass representation.

Honestly if you are a bass-sceptic, I would recommend you to give it a try. Get yourself a solid performaing pair of head- or earphones and give it a try. Personally I would recommend a pair of planar magnetin+c over-ear headphones like teh Audeze MM-100 or LCD-S20.
Their planar magnetic drivers enable wide and presise representation across the whole frequency range and offer great control over the sound.
From what I learned the Kiwi Ears Quintett and Moondrop Blessing 3 have a well-constructed and dynamic bass representation and may very well be worth a try.

### Conclusion

While I still remain sceptic about bass, but I am now a bass-enthusiast. 
Furthermore, I hope that you can gain teh same enthosiasm fpr bass-emphatic music as I was able to.
