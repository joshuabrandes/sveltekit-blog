# About Me

Hello, I'm Joshua, a software developer grom Germany with a passion for building robust and
efficient applications — and a deep fascination with sound.

## Expertise

My technical focus lies in the area of JVM languages and modern backend technologies. I have profound
knowledge in:

* **Languages:** Kotlin, Java, C++, Python, JavaScript
* **Frameworks:** Spring Boot, WebFlux, Svelte

_And I am a total fan of JetBrains IDEs._

Beyond software development, I’m also experienced in **audio engineering**, with a strong understanding of both the technical and creative sides of sound. 
This includes:

* **Live & Studio Engineering:** Mixing FOH and monitor sound for concerts and live events; studio tracking and mixing.
* **Music Production:** Arranging, editing, and mixing songs, often in the genres of electronic, pop, and cinematic music.
* **Tools:** Pro Tools, Logic Pro X, Ableton Live, iZotope, Waves plugins, and more.
* **Sound Design & Acoustics:** Creating custom sounds and atmospheres; understanding of room treatment, mic placement, and dynamic control.
* **Hardware Experience:** Working with analog/digital mixers, in-ear monitor systems, dynamic and condenser mics, as well as PA setups.

## Experience & Focus

As a software developer, I focus on developing performant and scalable backend systems, particularly those that benefit from reactive programming paradigms. 
I enjoy solving complex problems through clean and maintainable code — 
and I bring the same mindset to my work with audio: combining structure, intuition, and creativity to create something meaningful.
